# Breast-Cancer-Prediction

In this report, I am basically focusing on the Feature Visualization and selection of it. 
We have a Data of patients diagnoised for Breast Cancer.
Breast cancer is cancer that develops from breast tissue.Signs of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, fluid coming from the nipple, a newly-inverted nipple, or a red or scaly patch of skin.In those with distant spread of the disease, there may be bone pain, swollen lymph nodes, shortness of breath, or yellow skin.

Generally the origin of cancer is from a Tumor,now a person is having cancer if the tunor is Malignant.
We all know that cancers are basically of two types :
    ->Malignant:If your doctor determines that you have a malignant tumor, that means the mass is cancerous. The word malignant is Latin for “badly born.” This type of tumor has the ability to multiply uncontrollably, to metastasize (spread) to various parts of the body and invade surrounding tissue.Malignant tumors are formed from abnormal cells that are highly unstable and travel via the blood stream, circulatory system, and lymphatic system. Malignant cells do not have chemical adhesion molecules to anchor  them to the original growth site that benign tumors possess.
    ->Benign:A benign tumor is not a cancerous tumor. Unlike cancer tumors, a non cancerous tumor is unable to spread throughout the body. A non malignant tumor can be serious if they are pressing a primary nerve, a main artery, or compresses brain matter. Overall, benign tumors respond well to treatment and the prognosis is usually favorable.

Some suspected causes of benign tumors include a traumatic injury at the tumor location, chronic inflammation (or long-term stress that leads to inflammation), an undetected infection, or diet.
